Log4j Notes:
===========


i) What is Logging?

	Logging is the process of writing log messages during the execution of program to a central place
	
ii) why do need Logs?

	* If we use System.out.println() statements to print log messages, we can print only on console.
	* After executing one program when console is closed , we will lose all logs we can't reproduce the same log
	  after running any other program.
	* So with help of Log4j (Logger for java) we print/store logs/messages in separate files for each execution
	
iii) How can we achieve logging in java?
		
		With help of Log4j components
		
		Log4j Components:
		----------------
		
		* Logger -> a class inside org.apache.log4j.* package
					We have to initialize one logger object for each java class.
					We have logger class methods to indicate log levels.
					Logger class methods : debug,info,warn,error,fatal.
					
		* Appender -> to write messages into a file or DB or SMTP
					Several types are:
						a) JDBCAppender
						b) FileAppender
						c) ConsoleAppender
						
		* Layout -> to define the formatting in which logs will print in repository.
					a) PatternLayout
					b) SimpleLayout
					c) XMLLayout
					d) HTMLLayout
					
					  
iv) Log4j Priority levels:  debug < info < warn < error < fatal


v) Different ways to configure log4j:

	a) Basic configurator
			-> follows this pattern : "%-4r [%t] %-5p %c %x -%m%n"
			-> Basic configurator is suitable for tutorials and temporary purpose
			
	b) Property File Configurator
	c) XML configurator (DOMConfigurator)
